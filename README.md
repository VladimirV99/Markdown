# Markdown

A lightweight JavaScript Markdown to HTML converter based on [showdown](https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown). It includes a GitHub-like markdown editor for easier styling and previewing the HTML.

## Required software

NodeJS and npm are required for building and testing the project

## Building the project

Clone the repository and navigate into it

    git clone https://github.com/VladimirV99/Markdown.git
    cd Markdown

Then install the dependencies and run the build script

    npm install
    npm run build

That will generate and test the browser and node versions of the library in the build directory. They will be named markdown.js and markdown.node.js respectively.

## Testing

There are tests for almost every supported markdown rule. Once the dependencies are installed, they can be run using

    npm test
